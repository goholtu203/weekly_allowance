This is a python program that shows how i spend my weekly allowance step by step using arithemetic operators to perform the basic computations needed. 
Here is all you need to know about the program at each step.
My weekly allowance is 2000 naira. 
I spent ₦400 on books, and found ₦100 under your bed and added it to my allowance, I now bought snacks worth ₦250 and gave 25% of your current allowance to your younger sibling.
Then i used one-third of what’s left to buy data and split the remaining balance equally between savings and tithing.Finally, calculate what remains after removing all complete ₦100 notes using the modulus assignment operator (%=).
